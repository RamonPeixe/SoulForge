# SoulForge

Project developed for the TC1S5 discipline.

## Description

This project consists of creating a web page that saves the data of a soul, which requires some fields to be created, for example, the soul's name, date of birth, date of death and cause of death. It makes some checks, for example, if the date of death is less than the date of birth, the soul is not saved. Some functions have also been implemented to edit and remove the soul if necessary.
